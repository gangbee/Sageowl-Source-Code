    <p class="text-justify">
SageOwls.com is a simple and visually stimulating website designed to assist care givers with their care receivers (loved ones) financial, legal, and healthcare affairs. Being a care giver is emotionally and physically draining, therefore SageOwls.com was created to help the care giver through the time consuming and sometimes complicated process of managing care receivers day to day affairs, like paying bills, talking to institutions, for example, utility companies, and healthcare professionals.  The sites main focus is to act as a secure depository for important documents, like Durable and Healthcare Power of Attorneys, Living Wills, and Medical documents, that are needed to conduct daily business for a care receiver.  These and similar documents, from the convenience of a computer or mobile device can then be securely sent to any institution, medical facility, lawyer, or other designated company.
