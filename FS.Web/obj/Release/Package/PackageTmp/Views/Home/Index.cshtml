SageOwls.com is a simple and visually stimulating website designed to assist care managers with their care receivers (loved ones) financial, legal, and healthcare affairs. Being a care manager is emotionally and physically draining, therefore SageOwls.com was created to help the care manager through the time consuming and sometimes complicated process of managing care receivers day to day affairs, like paying bills, talking to institutions, for example, utility companies, and healthcare professionals.  The sites main focus is to act as a secure depository for important documents, like Durable and Healthcare Power of Attorneys, Living Wills, and Medical documents, that are needed to conduct daily business for a care receiver.  These and similar documents, from the convenience of a computer or mobile device can then be securely sent to any institution, medical facility, lawyer, or other designated company.  SageOwls.com also provides useful information for care managers and access to “The Perch” a community where care managers can gather and ask questions.</h3>*@

Many times, attitudes and beliefs form personal barriers that stand in the way of caring for yourself. Not taking care of yourself may be a lifelong pattern, with taking care of others an easier option. However, as a family caregiver you must ask yourself, "What good will I be to the person I care for if I become ill? If I die? Breaking old patterns and overcoming obstacles is not an easy proposition, but it can be done—regardless of your age or situation. The first task in removing personal barriers to self-care is to identify what is in your way. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think you are being selfish if you put your needs first?                                                                                            </li> 
<li>Is it frightening to think of your own needs? What is the fear about?                                                                                      </li>
<li>Do you have trouble asking for what you need? Do you feel inadequate if you ask for help?                                                                  </li>
<li>Do you feel you have to prove that you are worthy of the care recipient's affection? Do you do too much as a result?                                       </li>
<li>Sometimes caregivers have misconceptions that increase their stress and get in the way of good self-care. Here are some of the most commonly expressed:    </li>
</ul>

"I never do anything right," or "There's no way I could find the time to exercise" are examples of negative self-talk, another possible barrier that can cause unnecessary anxiety. Instead, try positive statements: "I'm good at giving John a bath." "I can exercise for 15 minutes a day." Remember, your mind believes what you tell it.
<p>
Because we base our behavior on our thoughts and beliefs, attitudes and misconceptions like those noted above can cause caregivers to continually attempt to do what cannot be done, to control what cannot be controlled. The result is feelings of continued failure and frustration and, often, an inclination to ignore your own needs. Ask yourself what might be getting in your way and keeping you from taking care of yourself.
